title: About The US Narrative For Today
---

<p>I'm fascinated with how people get their information each day. While social media is playing an increasingly significant role, newspapers is still how many folks get their information. I'm interested in understanding the role newspapers still play (or don't) in crafting the narrative of the country.</p>

<p>I began this journey recently by looking through <a href="http://www.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/?tfp_show=all">the front pages at the Neuseum</a>. I worked to try and automate the extraction of headlines from each of the papers, trying to craft a snapshot of the narrative for our country each day. The PDFs proved difficult to reliably get the top news stories of the day, as the words aren't always horizontally or vertically aligned in a algorithmically sensible way.</p>

<p>After going down this rabbit hole for a few weeks, I backed out and pulled a list of the domains for 2000+ newspapers from Wikipedia. Which I then harvest and parse an RSS feed for the publication where possible (not all have). Out of that I was able to get roughly 900 RSS feeds, which produce about 400-500 reliable stories for each day. From which I randomly grab a single headline for inclusion in the narrative of the day. It isn't always the top story, but it is a story from that particular publication, city, and state.</p>

<p>I have automated the discovery of feeds, the pulling of their contents each day, and the random selection of a single story for inclusion in what I'm calling the US Narrative for Today. I'm not sure what is next, but I will keep harvesting, publishing, and seeing what else I can derive, automate, publish, and share from across the US news landscape. </p>
